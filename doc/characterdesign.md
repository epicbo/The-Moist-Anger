##Primary Stats
A character has a few base stats. 
- Physique - How well built a character is. 
- Nimbleness - How quick on their feet and dextrous a character is.
- Judgement - How fast a logical conclusion can be drawn or just wit.
- Glamour - How easy a character is to get along with and leadership.

###Order of importance for different combat skills. 
This is just the primary stats though and soem secondary stats might affect certain skillsets more or less.

| Primary Stats  | Physique | Nimbleness | Judgement | Glamour |
| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Heavy Melee**  | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
| **Light Melee**  | 2nd | 1st | 3rd | 4th |
| **Ranged Attack**  | 3rd | 1st | 2nd | 4th |
| **Witchcraft**  | 4th | 3rd | 2nd | 1st |
| **Incantations**  | 4th | 3rd | 1st | 2nd |

##Secondary Stats
These stats generally change more easily than the primary stats and can often be mended and improved.

- Sanity - How grounded a character is in the real world. Seeing something scary or losing a close comerade can affect this negatively while something soothing or comforting can reduce this. Characters have a minimum value that you cannot get below and a breaking point that you cannot go above. 
- Endurance - How much physical abuse a character can withstand before getting grevious wounds. And how far a character can go on without getting fatigued.

##Defensive stats
A character can have many ways to improve their chance of survival.

- Armour - Defends from most physical attacks and does generally not stop, but reduce incoming damage.
- Dodge - Prevents incoming damage by causing misses. Can however rarely cause glancing hits which deal less damage but still hits.
- Block - Prevents incoming damage by blocking. Is less of an innate character trait and cannot be done without a shield or similar. Can cause glacning hits that deal less damage but still hits.
- Willpower - Prevents debuffs
- Resistance - Reduces incoming damage of certain types by a percentage. See [Damage Types](damagetypes.md).
