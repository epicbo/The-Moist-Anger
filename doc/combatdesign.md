#Combat Design
A combat is a situation that can occur to the party, whilst traveling or during a dungeon. 

##Combat Field
The combat field is divided into **two** five by four (*5x-4y*) rectangles placed horizontally adjecent to each other. Each field represents a teams formation. One team's entites can **never** enter another teams field. 
- Each square can only be occupied by a single entity at a time.
- Each square can only have ground effect at a time.

##Combat Targeting
Any skill have three representations in it's tooltip. 

1. The targetable squares which can be any or all positions in a field.
2. The positional sqaures which cam be any or all positions in a field.
3. The area of effect which can be any arbitrary numbers of positions **relative** to the target location. 

##Core combat mechanics
- Blocking - Some characters have to option block his or her square, preventing missiles and attacks to pass through their sqaure.
- Movement - **All** characters have a basic move option. Armour and class changes how far a character can move and some characters might be better at advancing than retreating or vice versa. 
- Movement as part of other skill - Many skills will have movement as part of their skill. A shield charge might reqire you to be in a position further back as it will move you forward certain amount of positions. The distance travelled may influence a skills potency.
- Retreat - Some combats might seem or be unwinnable with the current party composition. The only option to save characters might be to run away. 
- Leader - Every combatant group has a party leader. This entity may get benefits or drawbacks from having this position and may provide benefits or drawbacks to the rest of the party. Killing a leader will almost always have negative influences on their party. A leader can be higher level than the max level of the dungeon to a certain degree. But doing so will increase the pressure that character has on them, for better or worse.
