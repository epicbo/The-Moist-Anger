#Damage Types
There are many damage types. Some are advanced and rare while some are your everyday weapons.
##Physical
Physical damage is split into three categories and resistance is either specified purely as phyiscal or one or more of the subtypes.
The subtypes of physical damage is split into the three following categories. Damage from one weapon can be split into multiple types or all the same. Arrows generally do piercies only, while an axe might do both slashing and bashing.
- Piercing - Most common from arrows, daggers and lances.
- Slashing - Most common frow swords, glaives and similar.
- Bashing - Most common from maces and flails.

##Elemental
Elemental damage is generally rare, but can sometimes come into play. Examples can be torches which do bashing and fire damage. And item may give resistance to all elemetal types. Simply refered to as elemental resistance. Or it can give resistance to each individually.
- Fire - Most common of the elemental types. heat waves or a lingering fire does this type of damage.
- Cold - While rare, still quite common as naturally occuring damage from cold temperatures and water.
- Lightning - Very rare, almost never naturally occuring.

##Special
There are a few special case damage types that are rare, or does not fit another category. An item or skill cannot directly give resistance to this category of damage. Only invididually.
- Poison - Relatively common, but a special case nontheless. Hard to get additional resistance to, but will get a base value from your physique stat and endurance stat.
- Bleeding - While bleeding is a normally occuring thing for a group of adventuring, this is the kind of bleeding that will quickly end your life if not staunched. A rogue might target arteries and similar and case this kind of massive bleeding.
- Unholy/Holy - The rarest of all damage types. Can generally not be mitigated.
